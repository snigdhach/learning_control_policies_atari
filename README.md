# Learning Control Policies of Popular Atari Games

Implemented and benchmarked Model-free Reinforcement algorithms like Q-learning, SARSA, Actor-Critic, Deep Q- Learning and Double Deep Q-Learning for atari games, using OpenAI gym, in the application of game control.


Double DQN and Actor Critic displayed significant results in terms of faster training and sample efficiency respectively.
