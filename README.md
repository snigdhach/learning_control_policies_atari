# Learning Control Policies of Popular Atari Games

1. Implemented and benchmarked Model-free Reinforcement algorithms like Q-learning, SARSA, Actor-Critic, Deep Q- Learning and Double Deep Q-Learning for atari games, using OpenAI gym, in the application of game control.


2. Double DQN and Actor Critic displayed significant results in terms of faster training and sample efficiency respectively.
